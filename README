pycmdHome is a nifty little program that waits and listens for commands
sent through email. The command is executed with current user permission
and a reply is sent to the email sender.

Features:
* Sender Whitelist
* Subject Check
* Command Pattern Check
* Decode base64 emails.

Note: All emails are deleted right after they are checked.
